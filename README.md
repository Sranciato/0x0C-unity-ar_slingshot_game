## Story
This project was inspired by most of the arcade style mobile apps you see today. Taking inspiration from Angry Birds along with endless round gameplay like most games have on the app store. The focus was to create an experience easy enough for new players to pick up and start playing yet hard enough for an experienced player to want to beat their personal best score.
